batch_tree_generator.py

This script builds separate question trees for a subset of the base questions.
For each selected base question, it:
  - Builds an initial tree using process_question (from question_tree_manager.py)
  - Recursively generates additional variants (with a recursion depth of 3)
    so that the final tree has roughly around 500 nodes.
  - Saves each tree to a separate JSON file in the specified output directory.

Usage:
    $ python batch_tree_generator.py --num-base 5 --num-variants 10 --depth 3 --output-dir trees
